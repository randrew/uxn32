/* Runs up to 'limit' number of Uxn instructions.
   Returns limit - (number of instructions executed).
   Execution starts at address 'u->pc', so set it (or leave it) as needed.
   `u->fault` should be set to 0 before calling.

   After returning, `u->fault` indicates the reason execution ended:
     0: Instruction limit was reached before executing a halt instruction.
        The program needs to execute more before it finishes.
     1: The program halted normally after executing a halt instruction.
     x: The program halted after an error was encountered.

   `u->ram` should point to a buffer 0x10001 bytes in size. The extra byte
   prevents 16-bit POKE and PEEK instructions with address 0xFFFF going out
   of bounds. Uxn does not wrap those high byte accesses to 0x0. */
